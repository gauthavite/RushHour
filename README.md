# RushHour Programming Project

The purpose of this programming project is to write an efficient solver for rush hour puzzles, such as the one on the left. The goal of a rush hour puzzle is to help the red car to escape the traffic and reach the exit (on the right side). Horizontal cars can be moved left and right and vertical cars can be moved up and down. Cars are not allowed to move through other cars. One move is the displacement of one car to another eligible location. 

A solution to a rush hour puzzle is a sequence of moves that allows the red car to exit. An optimal solution is a solution with fewest possible moves.

To get a better understanding of the game, feel free to try and play rush hour, for instance at https://www.crazygames.com/game/rush-hour-online.
